# Untitled Ghost Game

Untitled Ghost Game (lovingly shortened to UGG) is a 2D Exploratory Puzzle Game for CS 4730 at the University of Virginia Spring 2020 semester. The team that worked on it is as follows:
- Design
    - Josh Santana
    - Jennifer Liao
    - John Perez
- Engine
    - Austin Bunting
    - Brad Knaysi
    - Michelle Lovering
- SFX
    - Peter Tran
    - William Wong
    - Joseph Kim


## Installation

If you receive the `fatal error: 'SDL2/SDL_mixer.h' file not found` message upon running `make`, you can fix it by running the following command-line command...

- MacOS users
    - `$ brew install sdl2_mixer`
- Windows users
    - pretty sure this issue only exists for MacOS
